## 2025-12-19 — Chapter 0 / Notebook 00 baseline complete

Completed the baseline (no mulligans, no selection) land-drop model for a 60-card deck using a hypergeometric formulation. Implemented utilities to compute P(X ≥ k) for lands seen by a given turn and generated a tidy results table sweeping realistic land counts for both play and draw. Produced a baseline plot showing P(≥2 lands by T2) and P(≥3 lands by T3) with an 80% reference line to support quick threshold readouts. This baseline now serves as the reference curve for future notebooks that add London mulligans, cantrips, fetch/surveil effects, tapland constraints, and player behaviour.
